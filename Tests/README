General Notes About the tests and the current state of the program

The program is not currently runnable. Most of the back end however works. Meaning that the implemented methods for merge, push,
and pull and the structure for the revisions and meta data are all solid. There are a few little bugs in there but overall
it's working relatively well. The program doesn't work due to the frontend currently not working. Meaning our parser and
operations(general control) modules are not currently functional. 

In terms of runnable tests, the test files for the revision history, file_system, and general_utility modules all should run. 
There are a few small issues there that due to the time constraints we weren't able to flush out. But it mostly works. The Cumulative Tests
file will definitely not run. The parser and operations test file essentially contains no relevantly programed tests so far. Most 
of them are trivial but they require some amount of knowledge of how the methods are implemented in order to stub the responses.
Since the methods aren't working at the moment, I dind't program the tests out.
